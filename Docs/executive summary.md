**Project Goal**  
The main goal of this project is to explore the connection between social media use and mental health indicators. We want to understand how digital habits, such as screen time, choice of platforms, and time spent offline, along with lifestyle factors like sleep, exercise, stress, and happiness, affect overall well-being. We aim to identify trends and point out factors that could help people improve or maintain better mental wellness.

**Motivation**  
Social media plays a very important role in our daily lives, especially for students. We all use social platforms and know about their positive and negative impacts. This made the dataset both relatable and relevant for analysis. Our goal is to explore these effects more deeply and possibly help promote healthier well-being in the digital age.

**Target Audience**  
The findings from this project can help several groups:

1. **Social media companies:** These companies can learn how their platforms may affect users' mental health. This could lead them to consider features or changes that may encourage healthier use.  
2. **Students and general social media users:** By raising awareness about how habits, screen time and platform choices influence well-being. This can help users make better decisions.  
3. **Well-being educators**: The insights can aid in guidance, awareness campaigns or interventions that promote healthier online behaviors.

Overall, this project can help individuals make better choices about their social media use and understand how their lifestyle habits may impact their mental state.

This project takes a closer look at the connection between social media habits and well-being. Using a dataset from Kaggle ‘**social media and mental health dataset**’. This dataset examines how digital habits link to mental well-being. It includes information on daily screen time, social media platform preferences, sleep quality, happiness levels, stress scores, exercise frequency, and days spent without social media. These variables give us a broad view of how different lifestyle choices and digital behaviours may influence overall mental wellness. Throughout this analysis we hope to answer the following questions:

**Question 1\.** To what extent is the number of days without social media related to an individual's overall wellbeing score?

**Question 2\.** What is the typical Age and Gender profile for users of different Social media platforms and how does their average daily screen time compare?

**Question3.** To answer these questions, the work follows a structured five-step approach, covering everything from planning and data preparation to exploratory analysis, visualisation and preparation for potential machine learning work.
